            <p>
                It's actually my first time writing or coding a letter to someone else, and I feel like I 
                had to write out my feelings with this. So, this past month and these days, your presence has truly brightened
                my life. Your beauty makes my heart skip a beat. I may look calm but in reality I feel dumbstruck by 
                your gaze. I am happy when you are near; my heart feels joy when you smile. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Please don’t mind my indifferent behavior. It may seem like I don’t care on the outside, but I truly am interested 
                in you. You had a certain glow that made you stand out, and I fell in love with it. It keeps replaying in my mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope you’re happy today and I hope you like my little program.
            </p>
            <p>
                All my 爱,<br>
